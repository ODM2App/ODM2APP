# ODM2APP
ODM2 APP is a software ecosystem for the management of the Observations Data Model 2 (ODM2).
ODM2 is an information data model for feature-based earth observations, designed to facilitate interoperability across scientific disciplines and domain cyberinfrastructures. The ODM2 data model is supported by the Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC).
ODM APP exposes an environment to insert and manage O&M data. Namely Update, Insert and Delete operations are possible. PostgreSQL/PostGIS is the RDBMS engine that hosts the physical implementation of the ODM2. The physical ODM2 schema comprises core, Sampling features, Provenance, Results.
